# An Introduction

Web Development is one of the most popular career paths in the Pakistan Industry. 
While `Web Dev` can mean a lot, at the surface level, it is about making websites and web applications.

The Web has grown quite a lot since its quick expansion over the past ten or so years, and we are seeing
a stage of rapid development and refining of the tools that we already have to make the process more
robust, easier to use, understand, and far more flexible than before.

Web Development includes many sub categories of work, it includes `databases`, an understanding of 
`client-server side relationship`, `client side scripting`, `server side scripting`, creating beautiful `frontend
design`, working with `backend` systems to handle data, `responsiveness`, and carrying the proper data between components.
It can include `network configuration`, `commerical`, `entertainment`, `public` or `personal web development`.

Web Development is usually broken up into `Frontend` and `Backend` design. What frontend refers to is usually the looks and style of the website / web application itself. Backend refers to how the different components interact with each other, how the data is handled behind the scenes, and what services are used that should not really be exposed to the user.

People doing web dev are either referred to as,

1. Frontend Developers
2. Backend Developers
3. Full Stack Developers

# Technologies

Getting that out of the way, the main or most popular components of web dev are,

1. HTML, the skeleton of the web pages
2. CSS, the looks of the web pages
3. Javascript, the interactivity between and in the web pages

Some other technologies used are,
1. PHP
2. Python
3. C# with the ASP.NET framework
4. Spring Framework, Java 

Most developers these days use different frameworks depending on their use case, and thus have different `stacks` that they use, which just means they use different conjunction of frameworks or technologies to meet their needs.

Some popular stacks are,
1. ***MEAN*** ( *M*ongoDB *E*xpress *A*ngular *N*odeJS )
2. ***MERN*** ( *M*ongoDB *E*xpress *R*eact *N*odeJS )
3. ***LAMP*** ( *L*inux *A*pache *M*ySQL *P*HP )
4. ***LEMP*** ( *L*inux *N*ginx *M*ySQL *P*HP )
5. ***Django*** ( Python Django MySQL )
6. ***Ruby On Rails*** ( Ruby SQLite Rails )

Where,
1. NodeJS is a runtime for JS
2. ExpressJS is a framework on top of NodeJS
3. MongoDB is a NoSQL database

> NoSQL databases do not follow all the rules of a relational database â€”specifically, it does use a traditional row/column/table database design and does not use structured query language (SQL) to query data.
> - [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/nosql-databases)

4. Angular is JS framework
5. React is another JS framework
6. Linux is an Operating System
7. Apache is a Open Source Software based server
8. PHP is another language like JS
9. Nginx ( say *Engine X* ) is another way to maintain a server
10. Python is a language
11. Django is a "batteries-packed" web framework.
12. MySQL is a SQL database

> A database in SQL Server is made up of a collection of tables that stores a specific set of structured data.
> - [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/databases?view=sql-server-ver15)

13. Ruby is a very mature dynamic language, much like Python and JS
14. *Ruby on Rails* ( or just *Rails* ) is a framework also very popular for web dev

# General

# Getting Started

There aren't many pre requisites for starting web dev. A general beginner's approach is to understand what frontend development firstly is, and then move towards a backend stage. There are A LOT of technologies out there, and it is not advised that you sit down to learn everything - commmon myth that learning more and more will make you more *experienced*. Usually, HTML is recommended, then CSS, then JS, and then either VueJS, AngularJS, or ReactJS for some front end fun parts. For starters, some good hands on knowledge with NodeJS and ExpressJS is recommend as well - just the basics of how to get started. 

After that, try out deploying one of your creations somewhere on a web hosting website, such as Heroku, MS Azure, GCP, or AWS! If you're a student, please do check out the [Github Education Pack](education.github.com) which has free credits for many popular services for university students just trying to put their work out there.
