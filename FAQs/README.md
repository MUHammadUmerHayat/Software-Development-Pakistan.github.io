# University and Degree:
**Q:** I want to go for a degree for software development, which one should I go for among BS(CS)/Software Engineering/ BS(IT) etc.

**A:** At least in the above 3 degrees, the difference in the curriculum is so little that it doesn’t even matter eventually. For more answers, check this or search the group.

**Q:** Does it matter which university I graduated from?

**A:** Yes it does matter a bit for the following:

<h1>Quality Of Education</h1>
Competition with your peers means better skills. Stronger network through alumnis already in the industry. Better prospects of getting into a Masters programme abroad. Looks better on paper.

However, you can overcome these by building skills and network outside the university, if you are coming from a low ranked university. Check this for more details on the topic.

**Q:** Which university is better among the ones offering a relevant programme?

**A:** based on the feedback people have given on the group.

### Top Tier
- Fast (Sindh, Punjab, ISB)
- NUST (ISB)
- LUMS (LHR)
- Habib University (KHI)
- Comsats (LHR, ISB)
- GIKI (KPK)

### Middle Tier
- DHA Suffa (KHI)
- NED (KHI)
- Punjab University (LHR)
- UET (Punjab, KPK)
- IBA (KHI, SUKKER)
- ITU

### The Rest
- BUITEMS (Balochistan)
- Bahria University
- Air university
- Iqra University 
- SZABIST

It should be kept in mind that because we have the valuable resource of the Internet in this age of humanity, most of things that are practically needed, expected, and which make students really stand out are really self learned. While this thread does not discourage going to University or disregarding it all together, readers should be aware that there are many things that University is simply unable to teach, due to a lot of reasons. These can be,

- Because of a very fast growing technological community
- Books getting outdated very quickly
- Courses are designed for the most average of students, not specifically targeted at high achieving students, thus impacting quality
- The system of marks and GPA discourages students to work on things other than their university syllabus due to the fear of falling behind in grades
- Lack of guidance about where to even start

## General Advice For University

Whatever University you prefer, you should keep the following things in mind while deciding about it, in general. These points are as follows,

### The Alumni

The Alumni of that University are actually very precious. Seniors, juniors, and graduates are willing to guide you and give you help if you ask for it. They are highly likely to give you very good advice early on. Whatever University you go to, it's very important to stay in touch with your seniors so you can learn more from them as time goes on, all the while learning from their experiences.

### The Free Time

Since many of the things in Computer Science / Software Engineering can only be really learned through a self taught experience, it's very important to note down how much free time the University gives you, and how lax it is in not over burdening you with work.

### Extra Cirricular

A good teamwork in companies and projects helps to move that project ahead. Unlike the common myth that great products are made by a single individual typin away at his keyboard in a silent, empty room, most projects are actually the result of very good cooperation and the collaboration of efforts between individuals that come together to make a solid project. 

### Societies And Events

Taking care of what societies that University has, and what events it holds. Some Universities have job fairs, or big events for competitions. Make sure to get into something that gives you room to explore in these events. It doesn't have to be all tech, what it should be, however, it should be about community building and engagement.

P.S: Take this with a pinch of salt since it's an opinionated list :)

**Q:** I have to choose an FYP soon, how do I choose a project?

**A:** FYP holds a significant importance when it comes to learning and landing a relevant job. A few most important things to consider while choosing the FYP:

### Relevancy

Since you are in the final year of your degree, you should already have an idea about what domain you would like to work with after you graduate. If you have a relevant FYP, it will help you learn practical knowledge about the domain. For example, picking a classification/regression problem with open data sets if you would like to work with data science in your career. 

### Realistic

Make sure you pick a project/topic which is realistic to be finished within the allowed time. It's fairly common to overestimate your own/team’s capability to solve a novel problem which doesn’t work in the end. You are not expected to build state of the art solution in a bachelor's FYP. Replicating an already built solution on different data/conditions or building applications on top of industry proven technologies are good ideas to be on the safe side in the evaluation. 

### Support

Make sure you have the support needed for whatever you are building. Choose the supervisor looking at their strengths and if they are able to help you build the project. Have regular meetings with them and set goals to make sure you are on the right track. Your supervisor gets paid for helping you so make sure they work hard to earn that money ;). You can also use the SDP group to ask questions from the seniors and have a mentor/supervisor outside the university.

**Q:** Should I go for a masters degree right after graduation or is it better to have some experience before?

**A:** Some good insights here.

# Working Towards A Good Graduation

While it is important that you concentrate and focus on your university's course outline or goals, most development and growth comes from having a good plan, a clear goal in sight, hardwork, patience, and discipline. 

It's important that you work with the time you have in University and build yourself up slowly by steadily. Here are some tips that are hopefully useful to you.

## Being Clear About Your Goals!

CS and SE ain't that hard - you can do anything you put your mind to. Even if it's `Data Science`, `Web Development`, `Operating Systems`, `Android Development`, you can learn pretty much anything you put your mind to. So firstly, the myth that,

```
I won't be good enough at this
```

Is just plain wrong. CS and SE students have their unique perspectives to offer, and their way of communication and ideas and the solutions they offer is what sets them apart from non technical people. While some people spend so much of their lives focusing on just learing how to use and get better with certain tools, CS / SE students spend time thinking about making software like that everyday! Doesn't like feel like a superpower? Which bascially means again, if you put enough time into something, you'll definitely get good at it.

So, now, all you have to do, is decide what to work on, and what to emphasize on.

## Is 4 Years Enough To Learn About Something?

4 years is definitely a lot from a growth perspective. Time comes and time goes, you might not be the best at what you learn, and that's completely fine. The point is to keep working on projects, keep trying to grow, and keep exploring and trying to grow your skill set. Not trying hurts, and it's better that you try your best in something, even though it might not give you 100% of the results you expect, because at the end of the day, you will learn something while doing so.

To quote someone from Quora,
```
"Remember it is not the money which converts into competency…… It is the competency which converts into money."
- [What you should know after graduation as a software engineer to get a job easily?](https://www.quora.com/What-you-should-know-after-graduation-as-a-software-engineer-to-get-a-job-easily)
```

## Show Off Your Projects!

The number one thing most university students are clueless about in their semesters are the projects that they want to work on. Some build very simple, done and dusted stuff, some like to go all out and do what they can, coming up with original, long, and big ideas, some lie in between.

But mostly, everyone shares the common problem of thinking of ideas in the first place. 

And while that project may well for the grading side, it's not something that students really show in their CVs and resumes because it isn't that great. 

But while the projects themselves can be simple, it gives your employers in the future more things to look at. For example,

1. How quickly you were able to learn something and build something practical with it
2. How creatively you can think about problems
3. What approaches you took to counter your problems

But perhaps the most common dilemma is that people don't show off their work.

Have a small project that you did for OOP or PF that worked with web development? Put it on your CV! Someone might be looking for a junior or intern web developer. 

Good at networking and made a small example of TCP / IP protocols in your project? Put it on your CV! Someone might be looking for students who understand networking.

Made a small project for database that tried to emulate different distributed databases and such? Put it on your CV! Someone might be looking for a database engineer.

The point is, you never know! 

## Contributing To OSS

Contributing to OSS might be a good way depending on your field of interest to show others that you are a willing contributor and who wants to give back to the community. Contributing back to OSS means that you,

1. Are able to understand and read code
2. Find it easy to expand with the ideas that other people have
3. Are good at communication and willing to talk and debate about different problems

## Questions

**Q:** Should only graduate apply for jobs?

**A:** Nope! You are welcome to apply and open up for internships as you keep growing. Most people do that in their junior year, and some talented folks even earlier.

# Self taught programmers
**Q:** Is a university degree necessary for having a career in software development?

**A:** Software companies are running businesses, they don’t care if the candidate they are hiring has a degree in computer science as long as the candidate has the required skills and can help them with running the business. 
Relevant degrees look good on paper and tells the recruiter that the candidate has studied the relevant courses so that gives them an edge but this is as far as it goes. You can overcome that by taking relevant courses yourself or building hobby projects. 

**Q:** What are some good resources for learning programming for a beginner?

**A:** Start from https://www.freecodecamp.org/ its a great resource to learn from. Also CS50 is an excellent resource for learning the basics of computing. Check out the [`Learning Resources`](https://github.com/Software-Development-Pakistan/Software-Development-Pakistan.github.io/blob/master/Content/Learning-resources.md) file for a complete related list.

**Q:** I graduated with X degree but now I am interested in switching fields to data science and AI, how do I get started? 

**A:** Three fundamental blocks that should be covered for data science are:
- Maths (Linear Algebra, Calculus)
- Probability and statistics. 
- Programming Fundamentals. 

And that's all you need. A basic understanding of all these is enough to get you going.
However you can continue building these skills while you are learning machine learning.
 
Start from https://www.elementsofai.com/ and then move to `Andrew Ng’s - Introduction To Machine Learning` course. Also this is a good course for applied machine learning. Andrew's course is more theoratical than practical, and `FAST.ai's MOOC` is really encouraged for those who want a good hands on as well.

Some machine learning components that you should have good grasp with: 
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Data visualization 
- Feature Engineering.
- Modeling 
- Validation, and cross validation. 

However, Data Science itself is a very broad term. It can refer to someone who does 
- ***Data Engineering*** - constructing pipelines, taking care of the data organization in a company, granting, access, and modifying data schemas as a whole, and who is responsible for the in flow and out flow of data
- ***Data Analysis Or Visualization*** - a section which attemptes at trying to make companies understand the trends in their data, either by easy visualization of numbers through charts, graphs, and other tools, or tries ot give people a quick understanding of the relationships between their different products and statistical measures.
- Or someone who works heavily on improving the model quality, and working on improving the feature quality of the given data.

Want a quick overview of what tools we have? Take a look at the [mini courses by Kaggle!](https://kaggle.com).

When you are confident with your fundamental skills, go for solving challenges on kaggle. They will give you a good understanding about real world machine learning problems. 

**Q:** What are some fundamentals every self taught programmer should know?

Generally it is expected in the industry that developers have a grasp in the following, irrespective of whether they have the degree or not.

- Object Oriented Programming
- Data Structures
- Algorithmic analysis and complexity.
- Git and Version Control
- Relational Database Management Systems.
- Good code practices, like, clean, easy to read code
- Basics of working with a CLI

**Q:** There are so many sub fields, which field should I choose for my professional career? 

**A:** Make sure you know the basics of all the sub fields, and what is required of you should you choose one of them. Also Check this. If you're just starting, go ahead and try out different stuff, give yourself some time for exploration. Once you're sure and find something fun and interesting, go ahead and do it!

**Q:** How do I make sure I am on a growth track?

**A:** The field is continuously evolving, make sure you are always on the track of learning what’s going in the domain of your interest and updating your skills. Some good ways of doing that:
- Subscribing to good and relevant newsletters. 
- Following tech leaders of the domain of your interests on twitter.
- Following subreddits on reddit. 
- Having paid subscription for learning new technologies (eg: frontendmasters, safaribooksonline etc)

# Final Notes

At the start, all of these seems heavily overwhelming since there are so many things to do, and so much to look into, but if you keep at it, you'll learn a lot, if not, more than all of this. Patience, discipline, and a strong self of self belief, confidence, determination is more often the not the winning point of successful people. Good luck!
